* Node: v12.22.1
* Npm: v7.15.0
* Truffle: v5.3.7
* Ganache-cli or Ganache desktop. make sure it runs on port `8545`, with same mnemonic as Metamask and enough Ethers to run the tests. you can start ganache-cli with the following command: `ganache-cli -a 50 -e 10000 -m "shallow more plastic pair asset rare inherit upon issue degree they hobby"`
